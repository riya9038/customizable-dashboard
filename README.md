## 🧠 How It Works

- Widgets are stored in a Redux slice `widgetsSlice.js`.
- Dragging and resizing actions update the Redux state.
- The updated widget list is saved to **LocalStorage** on every change.
- On app load, the dashboard reads from LocalStorage to restore the last layout.

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

- **Frosted Glass Effect**: Widgets have a subtle blur background.
- **Animated Interactions**: Smooth drag & resize animations.
- **Minimalistic Color Palette**: Light, airy, and distraction-free.
- **Floating Delete Button**: Easily remove any widget without clutter.
